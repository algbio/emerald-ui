# Emerald UI

**Interactive Protein Sequence Alignment Visualization Tool**, available at [algbio.github.io/emerald-ui](https://algbio.github.io/emerald-ui/)

Emerald UI provides advanced visualization of optimal and suboptimal protein sequence alignments, enabling researchers to explore conserved / robust regions between these alignments. These conserved regions are the alignment-safe windows introduced by the [EMERALD algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-023-03008-6).

## About EMERALD

EMERALD goes beyond traditional pairwise sequence alignment by identifying not just the optimal alignment, but also suboptimal alignments and regions (_safety windows_) where alignments are consistently reliable across different scoring schemes. This has been described in Andreas Grigorjew, Artur Gynter, Fernando H.C. Dias, Benjamin Buchfink, Hajk-Georg Drost, Alexandru I. Tomescu, Sensitive inference of alignment-safe intervals from biodiverse protein sequence clusters using EMERALD, Genome Biology 24, 168 (2023), [https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-023-03008-6](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-023-03008-6).

### Key Features

- **🔍 Interactive Alignment Visualization**: Explore the optimal and suboptimal alignment space between two sequences
- **🛡️ Safety Window Analysis**: Identify regions where alignments are conserved / robust
- **📁 Multiple Input Methods**: Upload FASTA files, search UniProt database, or paste sequences directly
- **⚙️ Customizable Parameters**: Fine-tune the suboptimal alignment space by adjusting the suboptimality threshold (δ delta), and fine-tune the robustness measure by adjusting the safety parameter (α alpha)
- **🧬 3D Structure Integration**: Overlay protein structure information when available
- **📊 Export & Sharing**: Generate publication-ready images and shareable URLs

## Technical Implementation

This application is built with:

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Algorithm**: WebAssembly (WASM) implementation of EMERALD
- **Visualization**: Custom Canvas-based interactive plotting
- **Styling**: CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Data Sources**: UniProt REST API integration

## Quick notes

* Leave the charactesr out when too zoomed out
* Add explanation of the blue line
* Crash report should tell the user to refresh the page
* Examples should give better sequences to test
* Try example should have a link
* Change example sequences
