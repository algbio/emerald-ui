# Emerald UI Alignment Graph and Safety Windows Side Panel - System Documentation

> **Last Updated**: July 28, 2025  
> **Status**: Current - reflects latest codebase including `showOptimalPath` feature and new General Info tab

## Overview
The Emerald UI alignment visualization system consists of four main coordinated components: a **PointGridPlot** (the main canvas-based alignment graph), a **SafetyWindowsInfoPanel** (the interactive side panel with general information, safety window navigation, and visualization settings), a **VisualizationSettingsPanel** (the customization panel for graph display options), and a **SequenceAlignmentViewer** (text-based sequence alignment display). Together they provide a comprehensive interactive visualization system for exploring sequence alignments and "safety windows" - regions of confident alignment identified by the EMERALD algorithm.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Main Container: AlignmentGraphWithInfoPanel
- **Location**: `AlignmentGraphWithInfoPanel.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates the interaction between the graph and side panel
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Manages shared state for selected/hovered safety windows
  - Handles navigation between safety windows (previous/next)
  - Coordinates hover/selection events between components
  - Auto-selects first safety window when alignment loads

### 2. Canvas-Based Graph: PointGridPlot
- **Location**: `PointGridPlot.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Interactive canvas visualization of sequence alignment as a 2D grid
- **Key Features**:
  - **Zoomable/Pannable**: Uses D3 zoom for navigation
  - **Minimap**: Small overview in top-right corner showing full alignment
  - **Safety Window Visualization**: Green bracket-style indicators on axes
  - **Interactive Selection**: Click/hover detection for safety windows
  - **Real-time Highlighting**: Shows selected/hovered regions

### 3. Information Panel: SafetyWindowsInfoPanel

  - **Auto-Selection Clearing**: Deselects safety windows when on General Info or Visualization tabs

### 4. Visualization Settings Panel: VisualizationSettingsPanel
- **Location**: `VisualizationSettingsPanel.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Interactive controls for customizing graph display elements
- **Key Features**:
  - **Graph Element Toggles**: Show/hide axes, axis labels, and grid
  - **Navigation Controls**: Toggle minimap display
  - **Alignment Data Controls**: Show/hide safety windows, alignment edges, and dots
  - **Real-time Updates**: Changes apply immediately to the graph
  - **Reset Functionality**: One-click reset to default settings
  - **Organized Categories**: Settings grouped by functionality (Graph Elements, Navigation, Alignment Data)

### 5. Sequence Alignment Viewer: SequenceAlignmentViewer
- **Location**: `SequenceAlignmentViewer.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Text-based sequence alignment visualization with biological highlighting
- **Key Features**:
  - **Amino Acid Coloring**: Property-based highlighting (hydrophobic, polar, acidic, basic, special)
  - **Conservation Analysis**: Similarity scoring and visual indicators
  - **Position Markers**: Every 10th position marked for reference

## Visualization Settings

### VisualizationSettings Interface
```typescript
interface VisualizationSettings {
  showAxes: boolean;           // Display X and Y axis lines
  showAxisLabels: boolean;     // Display sequence characters and position indices
  showGrid: boolean;           // Display background grid lines
  showMinimap: boolean;        // Display overview minimap
  showSafetyWindows: boolean;  // Display safety window brackets and highlights
  showAlignmentEdges: boolean; // Display probability-weighted connection lines
  showAlignmentDots: boolean;  // Display start and end point markers
  showOptimalPath: boolean;    // Display the blue optimal alignment path
}
```

### Default Settings
All visualization elements are enabled by default:
- **Axes**: Visible (X and Y axis lines)
- **Axis Labels**: Visible (sequence characters and indices)
- **Grid**: Visible (background grid for easier reading)
- **Minimap**: Visible (overview navigation)
- **Safety Windows**: Visible (green bracket indicators)
- **Alignment Edges**: Visible (probability connections)
- **Alignment Dots**: Visible (start/end markers)
- **Optimal Path**: Visible (blue optimal alignment path)

## Data Model

### Alignment Structure
```typescript
interface Alignment {
  color: string;
  edges: Edge[];                    // Probability-weighted connections
  startDot?: { x: number; y: number }; // Safety window start
  endDot?: { x: number; y: number };   // Safety window end
  textAlignment?: TextAlignment;     // Optional sequence alignment data
}

interface Edge {
  from: [number, number];
  to: [number, number];
  probability: number;
}

interface TextAlignment {
  representative: {
    sequence: string;
    descriptor: string;
  };
  member: {
    sequence: string;
    descriptor: string;
  };
}
```

### Safety Windows
- **Definition**: Rectangular regions in the alignment grid representing areas of confident alignment
- **Identification**: Have both `startDot` and `endDot` defined
- **Coordinate System**: 
  - X-axis represents the "representative" (reference) sequence
  - Y-axis represents the "member" sequence
  - 0-indexed internally, 1-indexed in display

### Safety Window Information Object
```typescript
interface SafetyWindowInfo {
  id: string;           // Format: "safety-window-{index}"
  xStart: number;       // Start position on X-axis (0-indexed)
  xEnd: number;         // End position on X-axis (0-indexed)
  yStart: number;       // Start position on Y-axis (0-indexed)
  yEnd: number;         // End position on Y-axis (0-indexed)
  xLength: number;      // Width of safety window
  yLength: number;      // Height of safety window
  color: string;        // Color for visualization
  alignment: Alignment; // Reference to original alignment data
}
```

## Visual Components & Rendering

### Canvas Drawing System (`../../utils/canvas/`)
The visualization uses modular canvas drawing functions with conditional rendering based on visualization settings:

This system provides a sophisticated, interactive environment for exploring sequence alignments with particular focus on safety windows - the high-confidence regions identified by the EMERALD algorithm. The tight coordination between the graph and dual-panel interface (safety windows + visualization settings) creates an intuitive exploration experience for biological sequence analysis with full user control over display elements, including the ability to toggle the optimal alignment path display.
